Things I felt confident with and things I struggles with:

I felt really confident with the HTML as well as a lot of the styling aspects of CSS. Trial and error was really what helped me out the most with getting the sytle I wanted in the CSS.
Also felt confident with things in JavaScript like writing the constants, the cached elements and the event listeners. Started to struggle a bit when writing some of the functions I needed in JavaScript. Was happy that we had the connect four and tic tac toe games to refernce because I felt lost a few times, and just could not figure out why some of my functions weren't working. 
After musch more trial and error I realized that some syntax from HTML and CSS wasnt quite lining up with what I was writing in JavaScript. Once I had begin to fix that, I noticed alot more things were starting to come together. Really impressed myself with my debugging skills with this project.

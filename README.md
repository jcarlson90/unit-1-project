GAME PLAN:

-Started off by making the HTML document and creating <divs>. Created a seperate <div> along with a button for a winning message and to ask the player if they'd like to play again. Also added in a google font for more original styling.
-After that a began to style the <divs> as well as the <body> and <h1> to my liking. Also had to do alot of styling to create the players inside the <divs> and adding hover effects before the player makes a turn.
-The Javascript starts of with constants to create the players "X" and "O" as well as all of the possible winning combinations. After that I created all the nessecary cached elements and also the event listener for the play again button. 
-Made functions last to do things like render a new game, check which player's turn it is, and to show a winnig message with which player won or if the game is a tie.

I felt really confident with the HTML document. Trial and error was really what helped me out the most with getting the sytle I wanted in the CSS. Making the X's and O's was deffinitley the most difficult part. I didnt want to use a font for the players.
Also felt confident with things in JavaScript like writing the constants, the cached elements and the event listeners. Started to struggle a bit when writing some of the functions I needed in JavaScript. Was happy that we had the connect four and tic tac toe games to refernce because I felt lost a few times, and just could not figure out why some of my functions weren't working. 
After musch more trial and error I realized that some syntax from HTML and CSS wasnt quite lining up with what I was writing in JavaScript. Once I had begin to fix that, I noticed alot more things were starting to come together. Really impressed myself with my debugging skills with this project.
